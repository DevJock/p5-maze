# MAZE
## WIP

Responsive Maze Generator for Now..

View it live [here](https://devjock.github.io/p5-maze)

To play with it, either change the framerate or use newMaze(size,[speed],[r],[c]) function with the following parameters

size -> sets the cell size
speed -> sets the framerate for building animation
r -> overides and sets the number of rows.
c -> overides and sets the number of columns

If r and c are ommited the maze is responsive and fills the screen :)
